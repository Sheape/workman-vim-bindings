# Notes
Rather than perform a complete remapping this keeps most keys in their colemak positions. However it remaps some keys to their qwerty positions to get qwerty "h, j, k and l" movement back. The only key that isn't in colemak or qwerty position (due to the logistics) is "j" and "J" for qwerty "e" and "E".
